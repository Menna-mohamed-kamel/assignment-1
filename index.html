Mouse over this paragraph, What I find remarkable is that this test kas been the industry's standard dummy text ever since some printer in the 1500s tnok a palley of type und serambled it to make a type specimen book; it has survived not only four centuries uf lettur-by-letter resetting but even the leap into electronic typesetting, essentially unchanged except lar an octasional 'Ing' or 'y' thrown in. Ii's ironic that when the then-omderstood Latin was serambled, it became an incomprehensible as Greek; the phrase it's Greek to me' and 'greeking' have commen semantic roots!" (The editurs published his letterin a currection headlined "Lorem Oopvam"). What I tind remarkable is that this text has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since some printer in the 1500s took a galley of type and scrambled ito make a type specimen book: it has survived not unly four centuries of letter-by-letter resetting but even the leap into electranic typesetting, esentially unchanged escept for an occasional ing' ur'y thrown in. It's irunic that when the then-understood Latin was scranbled, it became as incutuprehensitble as Grvek; the phrase t's Greek to me and greeking' have comman semantic rootal" (The editars pablished hs letter in a correction heallined "Lorem Oopsam").

These cases are perfectly simple amd ay ti distinguish In a frve bour, when our power of chnice is antammeled and when othing pivents nur being able a do what we like best, every pleasue is t be welcnmed anid every pain avoidel. But in certain cicumtances und owing to the clainu of duty ur the obliuationi of businis it will frequently occur thur pleasures lave to be rupudiated and unmovnces atcepted. The wise man therefore abways holds in dese muners to this principle of weiectiin: be rejects pluasutes to secure other gater pleasutes, or else he endures pains to avcid wure pains.
